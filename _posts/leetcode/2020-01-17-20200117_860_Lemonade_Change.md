1. Problem Analysis
  - Check all customers are available to be buy lemonade
  
2. Prerequisite
  - Need to count the bills as it's face value ( $5, $10, $20 )
  - Will be prettier if bills to be changed back is defined in some kind of data structure

3. N.B
  - There is no changes at first hand

4. Plan
  - Make size three array ant keep record of changes
  - If any kind of bills are out of stock, and if the situation occurred that the change is needed, it is not available to sell lemonade any more.

#define dollar5 0
#define dollar10 1
#define dollar20 3

private:
    int balance[4] = {0};

    bool lemonadeChange(vector<int>& bills) {
        int change = 0;
        int needed10 = 0;
        for( auto bill : bills ) {
            balance[bill/5 - 1]++;
            change = bill - 5;
            if( bill > 5 ) {
                needed10 = change/10;
                if( balance[dollar10] >= needed10 ){
                    balance[dollar10] -= needed10;
                } else {
                    balance[dollar5] -= (needed10 * 2);
                }
                balance[dollar5] -= 1;
                if( balance[dollar5] < 0 )
