1. Problem Analysis
  - Get the longest distance between adjacent 1's in binary expression of input N
  
2. Prerequisite
  - Nothing

3. N.B
  - Input will be positive always

4. Plan
  - By deviding N by 2, check the mod2 value and keep the position if it is 1.
  - if there is any position recorded, get the distance and update longest

5. Result
  - 0ms. 100%., 8.3MB, 62.5% Am I using too much memory?
  
```
class Solution {
public:
    int binaryGap(int N) {
        int lastpos = -1;
        int maxlen = 0;
        int pos = 0;
        while( N > 0 ) {
            if( N % 2 > 0 ) {
                if( lastpos > -1 ) {
                    maxlen = max(maxlen, pos - lastpos);
                    lastpos = pos;
                } else
                    lastpos = pos;
            }
            N >>= 1;
            pos++;
        }
        return maxlen;
    }
};
