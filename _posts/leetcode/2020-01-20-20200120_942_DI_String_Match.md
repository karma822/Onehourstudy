1. Problem Analysis
  - Get permutation that satifies the condition with character D and I
  
2. Prerequisite
  - Nothing

3. N.B
  - Return vector has one more item in vector

4. Plan
  - ~At the first time, there was no idea hitting on my head, so I tried to solve the problem by brute-force~-
    ~In this case, at most 10000! of computation is required. BAD~
  - Nothing to think more. For the character, I take minimum number possible, and for the character D, take maximum number available.

5. Result
  - 36ms, 95.06%, 10.1MB 50%
  
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> diStringMatch(string S) {
        int len = S.size();
        int hi = len;
        int lo = 0;
        vector<int> ret(len+1, -1);
        for( int i = 0 ; i < len; i++ ) {
            if( S[i] == 'I' )
                ret[i] = lo++;
            else
                ret[i] = hi--;
        }
        ret[len] = lo;
        return ret;
    }
};
